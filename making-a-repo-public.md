# Making a Repo Public

If you would like to make a repo public it will need to go through an OSS review process.  To start this process please make your request via the [Open Source Contribution Request Form](https://docs.google.com/a/pivotal.io/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdrzn21aISpWF0sU6wFJHWQxP9kVpcnqRPegkxuJvGedjLgwg/viewform?c=0&w=1).

Once the Admin team receives approval from the OSS Review Team to make that repository public we will change its visibility settings and contact you directly. 

If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to open an ask ticket.
