"__PIVOTAL INCUBATOR__ 

This is a Pivotal Incubator project. The Pivotal Incubator allows us to release new and interesting open source projects that may or may not develop into fully fledged Pivotal-supported projects. 

We designed this incubation process to ensure that new Pivotal projects have a healthy process for engaging with the open source community, up-to-date documents (e.g. READMEs, contribution guidelines), consistent licensing, and are developed using Pivotal’s accepted development practices."

The project also must include the following files*:

* a CONTRIBUTING file 
* a code-of-conduct.md
* a LICENSE file

_*These will be provided to you at the time you request to make your project open source._
