# __Creating a Repository__

In the new /Pivotal org, Pivotal team members are now able to create their own repos. 

To do so, please follow GitHub’s instructions on [How to Create a Repository](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-new-repository/).


### __Items to note [PLEASE READ]:__ 

  * At this time, we are only enabling private repo creation.  If you need to create a public repository, first create a private repository then follow the instructions for making repo public.
  * It’s our goal to offer read access across our org as much as possible.  When you can, on top of granting access to your teams and fellow contributors, **_please give read access to the All-Pivotal team_**.
  * In the same spirit of granting greater visibility and collaboration across our org, we are also asking that __new repos allude to the project and team, either in the name or through [GitHub’s Topic Feature](https://help.github.com/articles/about-topics/)__.
  * If you have any trouble please don’t hesitate to reach out to the admin team by filing an ask ticket.
