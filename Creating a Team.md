## Creating a Team

If you would like to create a team, the GitHub Admins would be more than happy to do that for you! 

**To create a team**, please reach out to ask@pivotal.io requesting your team be created and include: 

1. Team name
2. If, and where, that team should be nested
3. Which members should be added to that team
4. Which level of access those members need (Maintainer, Member)
5. Any repositories that team needs access to


### Items to note: 

The lowest level team should have the highest level access.  A child team will have access to everything the parent teams above it does, as well as whatever the child team is specifically granted access to. 

**Example:**

- Parent Team (Access - Parent Team Repos)
  - Child Team (Access - Parent Team Repos, Child Team Repos)
