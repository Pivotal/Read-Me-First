# Offboarding

Since our new /Pivotal org is SAML authenticated, when an employee parts ways with Pivotal they will now be automatically removed from our org once their Okta account is deactivated.  

Although a user will be removed from our org when leaving Pivotal, their user account will not be any impacted in any way.  In fact, to help with future career and personal goals - their commit history should stay in tact as verification of work done.
