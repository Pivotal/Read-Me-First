# Authorizing an SSH key

After you have been made a member of the new org, in order to use an SSH key you will need to authorize it for the /Pivotal org.

GitHub has instructions on how to do that here:  [Authorizing an SSH key for use with a SAML single sign-on organization](https://help.github.com/articles/authorizing-an-ssh-key-for-use-with-a-saml-single-sign-on-organization/)

If you have any issues or questions, please reach out to the Admin team by filing an ask ticket.
